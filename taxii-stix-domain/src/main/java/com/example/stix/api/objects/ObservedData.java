/*
* Type Name: observed-data
*
* Observed Data conveys information that was observed on systems and networks using the Cyber Observable specification
* defined in parts 3 and 4 of this specification. For example, Observed Data can capture the observation of an IP
* address, a network connection, a file, or a registry key. Observed Data is not an intelligence assertion, it is simply
* information: this file was seen, without any context for what it means.
*
* Observed Data captures both a single observation of a single entity (file, network connection) as well as the
* aggregation of multiple observations of an entity. When the number_observed property is 1 the Observed Data is of a
* single entity. When the number_observed property is greater than 1, the observed data consists of several instances of
* an entity collected over the time window specified by the first_observed and last_observed properties. When used to
* collect aggregate data, it is likely that some fields in the Cyber Observable Object (e.g., timestamp fields) will be
* omitted because they would differ for each of the individual observations.
*
* Observed Data may be used by itself (without relationships) to convey raw data collected from network and host-based
* detection tools. A firewall could emit a single Observed Data instance containing a single Network Traffic object for
* each connection it sees. The firewall could also aggregate data and instead send out an Observed Data instance every
* ten minutes with an IP address and an appropriate number_observed value to indicate the number of times that IP
* address was observed in that window.
*
* Observed Data may also be related to other SDOs to represent raw data that is relevant to those datatypes. The Sighting
* object, which captures the sighting of an Indicator, Malware, or other SDO, uses Observed Data to represent the raw
* information that led to the creation of the Sighting (e.g., what was actually seen that suggested that a particular
* instance of malware was active).

/*
*
* Type Name: sighting
*
* A Sighting denotes the belief that something in CTI (e.g., an indicator, malware, tool, threat actor, etc.) was seen.
* Sightings are used to track who and what are being targeted, how attacks are carried out, and to track trends in
* attack behavior.
*
* The Sighting relationship object is a special type of SRO; it is a relationship that contains extra properties not
* present on the generic Relationship object. These extra properties are included to represent data specific to
* sighting relationships (e.g., count, representing how many times something was seen), but for other purposes a
* Sighting can be thought of as a Relationship with a name of "sighting-of". Sighting is captured as a relationship
* because you cannot have a sighting unless you have something that has been sighted. Sighting does not make sense
* without the relationship to what was sighted.
*
* Sighting relationships relate three aspects of the sighting:
*
* What was sighted, such as the Indicator, Malware, Campaign, or other SDO (sighting_of_ref)
* Who sighted it and/or where it was sighted, represented as an Identity (where_sighted_refs) and
* What was actually seen on systems and networks, represented as Observed Data (observed_data_refs)
*
* What was sighted is required; a sighting does not make sense unless you say what you saw. Who sighted it, where it
* was sighted, and what was actually seen are optional. In many cases it is not necessary to provide that level of
* detail in order to provide value.
*
* Sightings are used whenever any SDO has been "seen". In some cases, the object creator wishes to convey very little
* information about the sighting; the details might be sensitive, but the fact that they saw a malware instance or
* threat actor could still be very useful. In other cases, providing the details may be helpful or even necessary;
* saying exactly which of the 1000 IP addresses in an indicator were sighted is helpful when tracking which of those
* IPs is still malicious.
*
* Sighting is distinct from Observed Data in that Sighting is an intelligence assertion ("I saw this threat actor")
* while Observed Data is simply information ("I saw this file"). When you combine them by including the linked
* Observed Data (observed_data_refs) from a Sighting, you can say "I saw this file, and that makes me think I saw
* this threat actor". Although confidence is currently reserved, notionally confidence would be added to Sighting
* (the intelligence relationship) but not to Observed Data (the raw information).

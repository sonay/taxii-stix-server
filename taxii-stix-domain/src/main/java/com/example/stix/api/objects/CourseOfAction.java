/*
* Type Name: course-of-action
*
* Note: The Course of Action object in STIX 2.0 is a stub. It is included to support basic use cases (such as sharing
* prose courses of action) but does not support the ability to represent automated courses of action or contain
* properties to represent metadata about courses of action. Future STIX 2 releases will expand it to include these
* capabilities.
*
* A Course of Action is an action taken either to prevent an attack or to respond to an attack that is in progress.
* It may describe technical, automatable responses (applying patches, reconfiguring firewalls) but can also describe
* higher level actions like employee training or policy changes. For example, a course of action to mitigate a
* vulnerability could describe applying the patch that fixes it.
*
* The Course of Action SDO contains a textual description of the action; a reserved action property also serves as
* placeholder for future inclusion of machine automatable courses of action. Relationships from the Course of Action
* can be used to link it to the Vulnerabilities or behaviors (Tool, Malware, Attack Pattern) that it mitigates.

/*
 * STIX Relationship Objects (SROs) represent types of relationships used to describe CTI. The generic Relationship
 * SRO is used to describe many varied types of relationships, while the specific Sighting SRO contains additional
 * properties to represent Sighting relationships.
 *
 * Property information, relationship information, and examples are provided for each SRO defined below. Property
 * information includes common properties as well as properties that are specific to each SRO. Because SROs cannot
 * be the source or target of other SROs, relationship information is included but only to describe embedded
 * relationships (e.g., created_by_ref).
